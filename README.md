# tile.music

tile.music is a work-in-progress music listening habit visualization platform. It allows users to track their listening history and explore their listening habits through customizable, interactive posters to download, print, and share. It currently supports Spotify, with plans to expand support to Apple Music, Last.fm, and manual tracking.

## Technologies

tile.music is built on top of [Supabase](https://github.com/supabase/supabase) using [SvelteKit](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit) for the user-facing application, with metadata powered by [MusicBrainz](https://musicbrainz.org/). It also features custom-built libraries, such as [Munite](https://github.com/tile-music/munite) for metadata matching and [Chamfer](https://github.com/notsoli/chamfer) for the customization engine.
