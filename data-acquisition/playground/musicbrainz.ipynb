    "# MusicBrainz Entities\n",
    "\n",
    "## Artist\n",
    "\n",
    "An **artist** is generally a musician, group of musicians, a collaboration of multiple musicians, or other music professionals who contribute to works described in the MusicBrainz Database. They can also be a non-musical person (like a photographer, an illustrator, or a poet whose writings are set to music), or even a fictional character.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Artist credits** are a list of artists, variations of artist names, and pieces of text to join the artist names.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Event\n",
    "\n",
    "An **event** is an organized occasion which people can attend and is relevant to MusicBrainz. Events generally refer to live performances, like concerts and festivals.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Label\n",
    "\n",
    "**Labels** are generally imprints on releases, and to a lesser extent, the record companies behind those imprints.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Place\n",
    "\n",
    "**Places** are areas smaller than a geographical region (like a building or an outdoor area) used to perform or produce music. It could range from a stadium to a religious building to an indoor arena.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Recording\n",
    "\n",
    "**Recordings** are unique audio data. A recording has a title, artist credit, and length. Recordings can be linked to tracks on releases. Each track must always be associated with a single recording, but a recording can be linked to any number of tracks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Release\n",
    "\n",
    "**Releases** are real-world release objects (like a physical album) that you can buy in a music store. When a musical product is issued on a specific date with specific information such as the country, label, barcode, and packaging, it is considered a release.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **medium** is a piece of media included in a release. It contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Information about the format\n",
    "- Position in the release\n",
    "- An optional title\n",
    "- A list of tracks\n",
    "\n",
    "Several media types exist, including but not limited to: CD, 12\" vinyl, and digital media. A medium normally has a tracklist.\n",
    "\n",
    "A **track** contains:\n",
    "\n",
    "- A link to a recording\n",
    "- Title\n",
    "- Artist credit\n",
    "- Position on the medium\n",
    "\n",
    "A track is different from a recording in that it is unique to a release; a number of different releases can contain the same recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Release Group\n",
    "\n",
    "**Release groups** are an abstract \"album\" entity. Technically, it is a group of releases with a specified type.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Series\n",
    "\n",
    "A **series** is a sequence of separate release groups, releases, recordings, works, or events with a common theme. The theme is usually prominent in the branding of the entities in the series. The individual entities will often have a number indicating their position in the series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## URL\n",
    "\n",
    "A **URL** represents a standard Internet Uniform Resource Locator and an associated description of that URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Work\n",
    "\n",
    "A **work** is a distinct intellectual or artistic creation, which can be expressed in the form of one or more audio recordings. While a recording represents audio data, a work represents the composition behind the recording.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Entities with Editing Restrictions\n",
    "\n",
    "The following entities can only be added by privileged users. See the specific entity page for more details on how to request their addition.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Area\n",
    "\n",
    "**Areas** are historical and existing geographic regions. These include countries, sub-divisions, counties, municipalities, cities, districts, and islands.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Genre\n",
    "\n",
    "**Genres** categorize music based on its style or other common characteristics.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Instrument\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instruments** are devices created or adapted to make musical sounds.\n"
